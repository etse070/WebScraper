# WebScraper

Author: Ethan Tse
Date: Fall 2021
Course: HR Management Senior Thesis Project (Hamilton College)

This is a web scraper I built in python for my senior thesis project in HR Management. The code in this repository collects data on president compensation and average faculty salaries for public and private colleges and universities. All data is sourced from *The Chronicle of Higher Education*.

I would like to acknowledge Ahra Wu, Hamilton College's data scientist, in helping me navigate the various external packages used in this program.
